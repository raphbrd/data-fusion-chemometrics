# Data-fusion in analytical chemistry

Authors: Thomas Pasquier, Raphael Bordas

## Code organization
- `main.py`: Entry point to run the examples
- `cmtf.py`: Contains the main class with an ALS-based implementation of the coupled matrix tensor decomposition
- `data/`: Contains the data from Acar et al. 2014 used in all analysis.
- `figures/`: Contains the figures generated by all scripts. It is created by the `main.py` script if it does not exist.
- `output_data/`: Contains the output of the examples. It is created by the `main.py` script if it does not exist.

Usage example:
- To reproduce the figures from the report:
```
python main.py
```
- To run the CMTF algorithm on the data:
```python
from cmtf import CMTF

# assumed at least a tensor and a matrix are loaded in the workspace

cmtf = CMTF(rank=3)
out = cmtf.fit([tensor], [matrix]) # tensor and matrix should be in a list

# out is a list of factors
# out[0] is the common factor to all tensors and matrices
# out[1] and out[2] are the factors for the first tensor
# ...
# out[-1] is the factor of the last matrix
```
